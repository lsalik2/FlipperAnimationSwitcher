# Flipper Animation Switcher

A Flipper Zero application for creating, managing, and switching **animation playlists** - template manifest.txt files that control which background animations play on your Flipper. Supports up to 128 animations per playlist.

## Default Animation Values

When an animation is added without customising its settings, these defaults are used:

- Min Butthurt: 0
- Max Butthurt: 14
- Min Level: 1
- Max Level: 30
- Weight: 3

## File Locations

- **/ext/dolphin/** - Animation folders (read-only by this app)
- **/ext/dolphin/manifest.txt** - Active animation manifest (overwritten on Apply)
- **/ext/apps_data/animation_switcher/** - Saved playlist .txt files

## Building

This app targets the **official Flipper Zero firmware**. Most custom firmware builds should also be supported.

Install and run ufbt - instructions on its official [GitHub page](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-ufbt).

## Roadmap

- Manual manifest.txt import as a playlist
- Automatic backup of the previous manifest.txt before applying a new playlist
- Animation previewer screen
- Increase maximum animation count beyond 128
