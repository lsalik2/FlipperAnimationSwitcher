# Flipper Animation Switcher

A Flipper Zero application that lets you create, manage, and switch between
**animation playlists** — template `manifest.txt` files that control which
background animations play on your Flipper.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---||
| **Create Playlist** | Select any subset of animations on your Flipper, optionally fine-tune per-animation settings, then save as a named playlist. |
| **Choose Playlist** | Apply a playlist (overwrites `manifest.txt`). A reboot prompt appears to activate the changes. |
| **Delete Playlist** | Remove any saved playlists. |
| **Preview** | Long-press any playlist to see which animations it contains. |
| **About / Help** | Version info and repo link. |
